**Project Title:**

MemGuard-Java: Fileless Malware Simulation & Detection (Pure Java Console)

> A safe, research-grade console app that simulates fileless-like behaviors (e.g., PowerShell-style commands, WMI traces) and detects them using behavioral rules, entropy/feature checks, and graph-aware heuristics — all in 100% Java (no native calls, no scripting, no execution of unknown content).

**Problem statement**

Problem. Fileless threats don’t rely on portable files — they abuse scripts, memory, registry, and living-off-the-land tools, evading signature scanners. Students and blue-team trainees struggle to get safe datasets and explainable detectors for these behaviors.

Target users :

> Security students & blue-team beginners (labs, demos)
> SOC/DFIR trainees who need explainable behavioral detections
> Hackathon/academic projects requiring safe simulation & evaluation
