Project title & brief description :

MemGuard-Java: Fileless Malware Simulation & Detection (Pure Java Console)

A safe, research-grade console app that simulates fileless-like behaviors (e.g., PowerShell-style commands, WMI traces) and detects them using behavioral rules, entropy/feature checks, and graph-aware heuristics â€” all in 100% Java (no native calls, no scripting, no execution of unknown content).
