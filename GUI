==================== MEMGUARD GUI PLAN ====================

AttackerPanel --> Attack Control interface
VictimPanel --> Victim System Monitoring
C2ServerPanel --> Command & Control Panel
DetectionPanel --> Security detection / alerts
ShellPanel --> Interactive shell interface
KeyloggingPanel --> Capture/display keystrokes
DBLogger --> MySQL logging (dedicated DB user)

Attack Simulation:

Virus Button --> Simulates file deletion (victim files removed), shows popup on Detection and C2 panels
Keylogger Button --> Starts keystroke capture on victim; keystrokes forwarded to C2/Attacker UI
Ransomware Button --> Encrypts files (simulation) and shows fullscreen “locked / ransom” page
Botnet Button --> Triggers periodic/continuous C2-driven popups or tasks on victim
Shell Button --> Establishes a reverse shell for interactive command execution

Tech Stack:

Language : Java
GUI : Java Swing
Networking : Java Sockets (client/server C2)
Concurrency : Swing EDT + background threads
Data Handling : Java object serialization (messages)
Persistence : JDBC/MySQL via DBLogger

Working (summary):

Attacker issues commands via AttackerPanel → C2Server relays to selected Victim.

Victim executes commands (delete/encrypt/popups/keylog/shell) and reports status back.

DetectionPanel shows alerts; DBLogger records events to MySQL.

Designed as an educational simulation — run in an isolated VM only.
